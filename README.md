# Leveraging the Power of Text Analytics to Inform Fire Managers

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for my MSBA capstone project for Spring 2024. This project was conducted on data provided by the University of Montana FireCenter from the WFDSS (Wildland Fire Decision Support System) database. It seeks to explore the applications of text analytics within the dataset. The primary applications examined were the potential to use classification modeling to find the text features most predictive of attributes like fire risk, acreage, and agency involvement. The code in this repository takes the data from its raw form, to a format suitable for analyisis, performs analysis, and exports data for visualization in Power BI.
