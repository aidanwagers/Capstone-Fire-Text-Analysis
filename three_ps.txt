Progress: I continued working on my classification issues and built out a few functions. 
Problems: I am still struggling with direction. All of the classification issues are kind of going nowhere.
Plans: I want to complete all classification work as soon as possible so I can be done with it and find something else.
Hours: In the last week I spent between 8 and 10 hours on the capstone.

Progress: I built out a random forest model and started work on a larger model selection function. I also completed my penalized logistic regression, naive bayes, and KNN testing. Logistic regression unsurprisingly performed the best. I made some progress writing as well.
Problems: I am struggling a bit with broad direction, I don't really know where to go with my final product.
Plans: By next week I plan to have the entirity of my rrf_rr_desc classification done. I would also like to finish the markdown cells.
Hours: In the last week I spent about 4 hours working on the capstone.
